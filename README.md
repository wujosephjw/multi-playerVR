# Collaborative Canvas: An Interactive Multi-User VR Space for 3d Creation and Exploration 
Author: Joseph Wu

A virtual reality application allows users to engage with 3D objects through actions such as grabbing and throwing, utilizing the VR controller for artwork creation and mesh modeling. The incorporation of a multiplayer mode enhances collaborative experiences, enabling players to interact, collaborate, and collectively explore 3D objects.

# User Narrative
In today's design teams, people often collaborate from different locations. It's crucial for them to work seamlessly together and have an efficient way of testing their ideas. This application provides the ability to create 3D models and collaborate in VR, improving the design process.

The main goal is to address the challenges in how designers typically work. Currently, they use drawings and various computer programs that don't communicate with each other. We aim to introduce a new type of computer program, known as virtual reality (VR) mesh modeling, to facilitate real-time collaboration among designers. The program is designed to simplify the collaborative process, facilitate discussions about designs, enable quick changes, and ensure inclusivity, allowing everyone to participate regardless of their level of expertise in 3D design.


# Interface Description
  •	Engage with 3D objects by pressing the grip controller button when close to the 3D object. It can throw and catch objects between users.
  •	Create a discrete or continuous 3D mesh in freehand using a VR controller by pressing trigger button.


# Built With
  •	Unity 2019.4.15f1
  •	Oculus Integration Package Version 23.0
  •	Deployed to Oculus Quest 3
  •	Normcore Unity networking plugin (https://normcore.io/dashboard/app)


# How to use
