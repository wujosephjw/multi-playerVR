# Collaborative Canvas: An Interactive Multi-User Space for Artistic Creation and Exploration 
Author: Joseph Wu

A virtual reality application enables you to draw in space by pinching your fingers, interact (scale, rotate, throw) with artwork, model an artifact, and engage in live communication. By integrating the advantages of multiplayer mode, players can interact, create, and explore 3D objects together.
